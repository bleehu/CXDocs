29	Rural Farmer	110	100	6	6	6	1	5	6	2	10	2	12	This farmer spends his life barely eking out a living in the far reaches of terraformed space, but don't mistake his bad luck and aversion to words for a lack of ingenuity. Any less capable person would have surrendered to city life long ago but this NPC trudges on through thick and thin, armed only with his wits, a well-oiled shotgun, and a plentiful supply of baling twine.

30	Brute Force Minion	90	60	7	2	4	1	1	7	10	-4	-4	6	You want AXE? This enemy won't get very far on their own, but point them at a target and they'll go to town! They've only survived as long as they have on sheer dumb luck.	Brute	1	ROSE	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	12
31	Engineer	120	150	5	5	7	3	10	7	7	22	8	12	This enemy has an easier time interacting with machines than with people, but despite his brusque nature, he is trusted and called upon whenever the local machinery misbehaves. While generally a reluctant fighter, this engineer will defend himself and his mechanical friends when threatened.	Infantry	10	ROSE	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	12
34	Pirate Script Kiddie	100	150	3	10	4	4	10	8	5	18	6	24	A scraggly small pirate wearing a duck taped rebreather. He also wears a HUD monocle over his left eye and a haptic glove on his right hand.	Support	5	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	18

Their tattered canvass vest adorned with an eclectic mix of survival tools and implements of combat. The swabbie is the lowest on the pecking order of pirates, and begrudgingly obeys the orders of any other crew member. The swabbie is greedy for booty and for distinction earned by violence.

12	Cultist Thrall	90	80	8	3	7	3	3	7	6	8	8	8	Poor robots corrupted and controlled by cultists as slaves. They stagger and move in an unnatural way, though they can still throw a decent punch and aim to fire alright. They still retain a befuddled sense of their former selves which has been twisted to fit the cultist's agenda. An enthralled mall cop robot may want to encourage a "safe environment" for "mercantilism" by guarding a cultist's tower while he works his dark magics. A former solider bot may refer to his cultist master as "General" and comply with any "orders."	Swarm	1	Bleehu	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	6
13	Cultist Warlock Mage	100	200	4	8	5	8	10	6	2	14	18	16	A talented practitioner of the dark arts. Often, but not always accompanied by initiates who study and serve under them. They hold the secrets to casting some of the nastiest spells known to human kind. Brave at the head of a group of loyal and expendable followers, they tend to be cowards when caught alone. They typically see humans as the ultimate form of consciousness in the galaxy, and look on the robots that they enthrall as getting what they deserve.

10	Growing Myriad	1	200	1	2	1	1	10	10	1	6	16	-4	A shimmering distortion of the air catches your attention. They way it twists and curls, flowing over itself makes you think it is not a mere heatwave. -Knowledge of nanites (Skill 5) or DC 25: You recognize the swirling pattern as a collection of nanites. It seems as though they are master-less, and could be dangerous to approach as you do not know their function. -Knowledge of nanites (Skill 25) or DC 50: These nanites seem to have a will of their own. They seem to be a collection from different types of nanites, all driven together by one particular function. You get the feeling that shooting it with regular bullets may not be as effective as it would be against more physical targets. -Knowledge of nanites (Skill 50) or DC 75 or Trigger Absorb: Any nanites sent in the direction of this monster have a high chance of being absorbed by the Myriad itself, adding hit points to its volume.

17	Rigistruct Marine Private	120	80	7	4	7	6	3	7	3	12	14	10	A young marine in setting-appropriate camoflaged armor with the tell-tale Rigistruct Corporation orange trim. Privates typically serve with a squad of at least 6 people. Of those, at least one is usually a sergeant or higher. In addition, another one of those is usually a medic or an engineer. Privates tend to be inexperienced and might be either brash and overconfident or timid, gunshy and hesitant. Either can be fatal in a firefight. Most Privates tend to believe strongly in Rigistruct ideals of hard work and loyalty. Even those with doubts about the infallibility of the corporation prize the ability to get things done and look down on being a "squeaky wheel". Privates can be human or Security drones and even on rare occasion a Tundari. Different species typically get along well in the Rigistruct Navy, as racism is a form of disloyalty to the corporation and the Navy, which should be of more value than one's personal tastes.

They usually accompany a squad with the directive to keep them all in one piece. Where a typical marine might be gunshy or gung-ho, almost all medics have the same compulsion to remember everything and follow the strict procedures that they've just spent two hard years learning. They each react differently to finding out that no plan survives contact with the enemy. 	Healer	1	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	4

The scars on their skin, fur or metal casing tell the tale of several tours of duty. They show the use of shrewd tactics and care deeply about the men, women and machines in their squad. The sergeant often considers tactics that are out of the box, such as resolving conflicts with negotiation instead of combat. Sergeants tend to require unquestioning loyalty and obedience from their soldiers and deal with insubordination quickly and harshly. They deal with mortal threats to those under their command even more harshly typically with lethal force. 	Leader	1	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	16

His voice is a gruff and scratchy bark that comes from an impressively long time surviving by drinking grog. The taskmaster has the personality of a force of nature. He is convicted in his belief in the law of the jungle. His tactics are elegant in their simplicity and are carried out with no hesitation and with violence of action. He finds subtly to be fatally nuanced and finds the way to motivate his men is by shouting and hitting. While he perfers to be loud and destructive, he is not above deception. He admires underhanded strategies and abhors a fair fight.	Leader	10	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	12

This is when the tinker leaves his loud, dark engine room to construct turrets and other helpful dohickeys that make life easier for him and his fellow crewmates.

His hands have long spindly fingers and well-fitting leather gloves with the fingers cut off. A talented pilot, yet even more so in his own mind. The helmsman is somewhere in the middle of the pecking order, and follows the barking orders of his taskmaster or captain with a feverish tempo which makes he and his crew all the more dangerous.

41	Adaesit Vermis - Adult	100	1	10	3	10	1	1	2	1	10	10	-2	Unintelligent gargantuan tube worms that feed off radiation, the adult Adaesit has the power to consume a small craft whole. While not the natural food of the giant radiavore, the warp cores and similar propulsions systems of current vessels make for an appetizing snack for the beasts. \r\n\r\nWhile a free-floating Adaesit is not very dangerous as long as you remain out of its reach, never approach an asteroid or other celestial body if you have a suspicion there is one residing there. They will nest in asteroids, dead moons, and even the skulls and carcasses of other large void creatures. The lethargy you may see in a free-floating worm will disappear once it has firm footing beneath it's tentacle-like appendages that sprout from the top of each segment of it's body. These tentacles have suckers on the end, keeping the worm safely attached to whatever it has made its home, and allowing it to move quickly to snatch anything it may want to eat straight out of anywhere above it. \r\n	Lurker	8	Rev	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	-4

They grow quickly, and while one may not seem a problem, it is easy to go from one to an infestation. Equipped with a giant sucker, excellent for planting themselves on ships, the small creatures move in swarms. With enough of them on a ship, they will quickly drain the power cores, often crawling in through the exhaust vents. \r\n\r\nAlways do a routine sweep of the exhaust system after visiting any rim space.

He moves quietly, blending in where he can and carries a rather large bulky bag which could contain a large musical instrument, or something a little more deadly. Perhaps under his weathered coat and shades he would have tattoos that might hint at whom sent him. Perhaps not. \r\nThe Hitman can comfortably work alone, but prefers to work with flatfoots  or underlings. Someone to blame if the operation goes awry. Someone to get to do the heavy lifting. The hitman is listed as having several primary weapons, but only carries one primary at a time, appropriate to the mission which the boss has sent him on.

Triad smugglers are streetwise, shifty and stealthy from years of operating on the wrong side of the law. In terms of personality, smugglers tend to be avoidant of confrontation or obstacles where they can. But baring that, with their backs against the wall, Triad smugglers can be quite lethal. They have a number of unique skills such as piloting, lockpicking, stealth and persuasion which helps keep them alive in their dangerous line of work.

Typically they are pressed into service by a need for more drugs or money that they owe from gambling. They tend to make up for a lack of intelligence, discipline or finesse with grit, ruthlessness and strength. They tend to have the appropriate tattoos and scars that come from a life in debt to the triad. The boss sends them typically in support of others that he has also sent to do his bidding.

They are deployed with no indication of their identity, and if caught they are disavowed. The Saboteurs are employed to commit acts of industrial sabotage and asset denial, whether to protect the well-being of Rigistruct citizens on gain an edge in corporate power struggles. Saboteurs are both skilled explosive experts, stealth experts and hackers. Lockpicking is also a required skill. They are no strangers to violence.

Myriads use nanites rather than health. As a swarm enemy, each weapon type does a specific amount of damage:\r\n                       Standard, single bullets: 1 per bullet fired\r\n                       Buckshot: 2 per shrapnel hit.

Its clawed bipedal feed naturally planted just a little wide for stability, while its long neck protrudes forward to give its angular head optimal chomping angle. The drone's metallic scaled outer plating courses with nanite emitted light. The drone cannot speak but understand the native language of their summoner. Being pack hunters, they often emote in a sort of wolfish way, nodding their heads or hissing to express acknowledgment or hostility respectively. Their quick jerky motion would seem to indicate that they are fairly agile, but they don't seem to look around unless directed. 	Minion	4	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	8
54	Machine Empire Vagabond	130	90	8	8	8	4	4	9	2	12	12	22	The Machine Empire consists mostly of refugees and vagabonds. Droids and machines that have been liberated from their cruel enslavement at the hands of the Terran Empire and her Organic-dominant society. The vagabonds typically have thrown off the yoke of indentured servitude only to have to scrap out a living in the mostly impoverished Empire to survive. Most vagabonds are bipedal, two-armed droids about 2 meters tall give or take. Like most of the denizens of the Machine empire, they require periodic access to energy to stay alive. The personalities of vagabonds vary greatly. Some are cold and calculating, some are fairly empathetic. But desperation changes behavior and even the most noble vagabond can be driven to drastic action to preserve themselves or their batch. Vagabonds are not trained specifically for combat, but rather are generalists under the authority of His Rootness (May he Compute Forever) the Emperor 0x000000. As such, they often have a variety of skills ranging from dish cleaning, to construction.	Infantry	5	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	8

Most of these droids are not trained for combat. Most of these droids have their freedom and not much else. And so must fight to survive. Most Refugee bots are bipedal and have two arms. They typically stand around 2 meters tall, give or take. Like most droids in the Machine Empire, Refugees need to consume energy periodically to continue to survive. Each Refugee droid doesn't have built-in infra-red vision, as these are standard for security droids, but not all droids. They don't have to breathe however and can move through water, poisonous gas or a vacuum without ill effect. 	Minion	1	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	10

Her arms show well-defined bulges of muscle under her standard Granger Dark blue uniform. Her keen eyes seem to glint even through the tint of her gunnery sunglasses.

MCDs carry a backpack with the latest of Rigistruct medical equipment, capable of diagnosing and treating a wide variety of maladies in the field. Often with the expediency required by combat.

Much like a teddy bear to his squadmates, he tends to get jokes slower than the others, but laugh louder to make up for it. He has a knack for putting his collection of grenades where they should go to cause maximum disruption. His more imposing form also makes him more punishing in melee combat. Grenadiers are often prone to overagression, and believe there is no kill like overkill. Without more strategic direction, they tend to eliminate the closest target before prioritizing more advantageous adversaries.	Artillary	5	Mike(ADMIN)	2017-11-01 22:40:22.227657	\N	f	14

9	45	30	Developed in conjunction with the SISMG and SIPAR, the plasma carbine which is standard issue for all Rigistruct Marines never jams. Instead, when it does malfunction (rolls a 1) it uses a complex but robust series of auxiliary systems to vent excess plasma away from the operator. It's not a particularly accurate wepon, but hits with the device do leave a plasma burn token on the target.

19	60	80	3 Miss chance -1 for every 3 strength in automatic fire. A favorite of hitmen and agressors of ill repute.

21	70	30	The experimental Rigistruct Designated Marksman rifle is the weapon of choice for the corporation's clandestine operators. The integrated suppressor helps maintain discretion at the cost of some range and damage. The weapon itself is a nonreflective matte black with angular body and stock. The arch rails are also made with crisp angles, on which sits a red dot sight. The barrel sits in a rounded square baffle that runs the length of the weapon, but the baffle doesn't seem to have any heat sinks. Perhaps this hints at the weapon's rate of fire? If the weapon would jam, it instead ejects an extra casing. 	Rigistruct XDMR-14-SD	Mike(ADMIN)	Carbine	30	20	45	65	2	4	5	3	30	0	0	0	1590	Medium	2017-11-01 22:40:45.493946	\N

22	55	6	The matte black boxy looking pistol is tipped with a suppressor that is almost as long as the barrel. The eject on the side of the action looks surprisingly large compared to the grip surrounding the magazine. Despite the length of the suppressor, it appears to be carefully balanced by the way it rests in the user's hand.

23	30	30	Several drones which are constructed by engineers or summoned by summoners come with ancillary light caliber weapons mounted on them commonly known as "popguns". They typically have a short chrome barrel and a boxy housing mounted to the back or body of the owner. As such, the weapon is always drawn and cannot be holstered. A DC 60 repair roll or equivalent must be passed in order to recover the weapon from a downed enemy and still have the weapon operate.

24	45	20	he standard-issue weapon of choice for the Machine Empire. It is manufactured domestically. The bullpup design facilitates handling the larger and more expensive electric discharge round. While the typically bare rails and lack of an ergonomic foregrip reflect its common use among machines. On hit, the target must make a DC 40 shock check, or lose an action next turn due to tazing. Please note that many cybernetic species have a weakness to shock damage, such as Security Drone and Cyborg. It makes a distinctive electric crackling sound when fired.

16	9	1	Deals 9 x strength damage. A favorite among pirates who engage in the often cramped quarters of space ships, the bosun's "brass" knuckles are actually crude heavy chunks of starship steel plate with a grip cut into it and rounded off so as not to cut the wearer. Minimum strength of 5 to wield. 	Bosun's Brass Knuckles	Mike(ADMIN)	Melee	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	15	0	10	0	200	None	2017-11-01 22:40:45.493946	\N
25	15	3	A tazer pistol with a black memory foam handle and a yellow and black striped flat front muzzle. The yellow lightning bolts emblazoned on the sides clearly differentiate it from a more lethal weapon.\r\nIf this weapon hits a target's health, then that target must pass a DC 110 shock save. If they succeed, they lose one action on their next turn and shake off the rest of the effects of being tazed. If they fail, they lose 4 actions on their next turn and the DC for their next taze roll is reduced by 10. Hits with this weapon leave pitons and wires embedded in their target which can be shaken off with an action and a reflex save of DC 30. As long as the pitons are still in their target, once per round the wielder of the tazer can spend one action per target and re-administer the shock save.\r\nPlease note that many cybernetic species have a weakness to shock damage, such as Security Drone and Cyborg. It makes a distinctive electric crackling sound when fired. 	Police Tazer Pistol	Mike(ADMIN)	Pistol	20	5	10	15	2	4	6	2	30	0	30	0	700	Light	2017-12-27 23:32:42.875108	\N
26	8	0	A large shield made of armor plate capable of deflecting bullets and melee weapons alike. Gives the wielder an additional 4 APL in a 180 degree cone. Can be used to shield bash for 8 x Strength (not Strength Mod) in 1m. On hit, target must make a FORT save opposed by the wielder's strength roll or be knocked prone.

28	70	6	The MSE-8a is produced in the Machine Empire mostly for use in close-quarters combat against other rogue cybernetics. Once a target is hit with this weapon, they must roll three DC 40 Shock checks and lose an action next turn due to tazing for each roll failed. On success, no tazing effect occurs. The MSE-8a is a pump action, so the unit using it must spend an action operating the rack between shots. The gun itself has a dull chrome sheen to it, a hollow metal plate buttstock and a large round recoil-compensating barrel grip. When loaded, the gun glows with an electric blue light. This light dies when the gun is empty.	MSE-8a Taser Shotgun	Mike(ADMIN)	Shotgun	22	5	15	25	1	3	4	1	35	0	6	0	2000	Light	2018-01-03 23:13:38.532342	\N
