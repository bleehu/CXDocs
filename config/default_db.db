26	Pirate Helmsman	90	140	3	9	4	8	9	10	6	14	12	26	The bearded beanpole of a man peers at you shiftily from hairy eyebrows. He wears a dark, stained hankerchief as a dew rag and sucks puffs of air from a functioning but ramshackle respirator. His hands have long spindly fingers and well-fitting leather gloves with the fingers cut off. A talented pilot, yet even more so in his own mind. The helmsman is somewhere in the middle of the pecking order, and follows the barking orders of his taskmaster or captain with a feverish tempo which makes he and his crew all the more dangerous. 	Support	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
1	Pirate Breacher	210	70	8	3	10	2	2	6	2	12	12	6	A 200lb 6 foot man holding a crude rusty shotgun walks with a heavy gait. His hair is greasy and wild, and should you get close enough, you smell that he clearly has not showered in days. He wears a gas mask over his face patched with duct tape, but the soft "cooh-pah" that it makes in time with his breathing clearly shows that it is functional.

12	Cultist Initiate	70	140	53	6	6	2	9	5	3	18	14	10	A hooded figure wearing white robes seems to glide creepily along the ground. It's skin is a pale sickly green. As it waves its hands around, purple glowing nanite energy swirls in the air behind its gestures. Its movements are light, quick and deliberate. Despite the odds against it, it shows no signs of fear. Nor any emotion really at all. 	Swarm	5	Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
14	Snow Bullymong	190	70	11	6	14	1	2	8	2	20	18	16	This 8 foot tall angry primate has three sets of sharp white fangs and ropey long white fur. It moves on all six limbs, but rears up on its hinds legs to fight. Each arm has a four-fingered hand with short, sharp claws which dig into the ice. 	Brute	5	Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
20	Pirate Gunslinger	90	90	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	Never without his trusty pistols. He has a keen eye and a cowboy hat.	Infantry	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
21	Pirate Medic	90	90	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	Prescribes so many doses of grog, you begin to wonder if he's getting kickbacks...	Infantry	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
22	Pirate Maniac	170	90	8	8	10	2	4	6	8	14	10	16	This Pirate loves fire. His hair is singed and he has a wild look in the eyes that hide behind ash-encrusted ballistic goggles. His muscles bulge and he seems to be a bit jumpy. His laugh, which he employs inappropriately often is a mad cackle.	Controler	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
23	Pirate Crackshot	110	110	8	12	6	4	6	4	4	12	8	20	A dew-rag wearing pirate with visible neck tatoos of skulls that extend down his arm. His mask dangles from it's straps around his neck to leave his eyes and ears unobstructed. 	Anti-Armor	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
24	Pirate taskmaster	130	130	6	8	8	8	8	6	4	20	20	16	An eyepatch and a long, dark, curly and unkempt beard grace the scarred face of the taskmaster. His voice is a gruff and scratchy bark that comes from an impressively long time surviving by drinking grog. The taskmaster has the personality of a force of nature. He is convicted in his belief in the law of the jungle. His tactics are elegant in their simplicity and are carried out with no hesitation and with violence of action. He finds subtly to be fatally nuanced and finds the way to motivate his men is by shouting and hitting. While he perfers to be loud and destructive, he is not above deception. He admires underhanded strategies and abhors a fair fight. 	Leader	8	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
25	Pirate Tinker	110	150	4	8	6	6	10	8	6	20	12	20	The tinker is usually charged with keeping the pirate ship running and feels quite at home in the engine room. However, often the pirates have need of securing a beach head or fortifying a position. This is when the tinker leaves his loud, dark engine room to construct turrets and other helpful dohickeys that make life easier for him and his fellow crewmates.	Controler	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
27	Pirate Swabbie	110	80	4	4	6	7	3	8	8	6	14	12	The long unkempt hair of the pirate is tied back with a stained strip of cloth. Their tattered canvass vest adorned with an eclectic mix of survival tools and implements of combat. The swabbie is the lowest on the pecking order of pirates, and begrudgingly obeys the orders of any other crew member. The swabbie is greedy for booty and for distinction earned by violence. 	Minion	1	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
28	Pirate Script Kiddie	100	150	3	10	4	4	10	8	5	18	6	24	A scraggly small pirate wearing a duck taped rebreather. He also wears a HUD monocle over his left eye and a haptic glove on his right hand. 	Support	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
29	Pirate Briggand	190	70	14	6	14	2	2	4	5	20	4	14	A very large bulky and hairy pirate with an eyepatch. Their biceps are the size of beach balls. The expression under the rebreather mask is made up of about 20% unfocused anger and 20% confusion followed by 60% vacancy. Their heavy gait would seem to indicate that they would be rather fast if not for the impressive amount of heavy equipment that they lug. 	Anti-Armor	10	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
15	Cultist Thrall	120	70	7	2	7	2	2	6	2	6	6	4	A Security drone worn from neglect and moving shakily. It carries a weapon and shambles to do its owner's bidding. The brutal reprogramming sometimes leaves ...	Infantry	1	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
31	Kletturkett	350	35	14	4	30	1	2	4	5	52	50	4	A six legged beast with thick armored scales from the deserts of New Talon. It's long wicked claws and crocodile teeth make it a mean beast to tangle with. While they aren't particularly quick, their hide is very tough and their appetite for human-sized meat is insatiable. 	Brute	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
32	Tinker Turret	130	60	2	8	8	1	1	3	2	6	6	10	This boilerplate mechanical turret has been constructed crudely from space junk, but it still shoots just fine. It has a motorized articulating base, Network Interface Card, targeting computer, ammo counter sensor, targeting sensor camera and even a salvaged friend-or-foe ID microprocessor. A skilled hacker may be able to disrupt the turret with a hacking check of 65, or even assume direct control of it with a hacking check of 85. The turret is mechanical/cybernetic in nature, and so is immune to poison, disease, etc. But the turret takes double damage from electric attacks. It's makeshift nature also leaves it vulnerable to explosive damage, such as grenades. It takes double damage from those as well. 	Anti-Armor	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
33	Lady Tia the Divine	230	250	8	10	12	12	12	8	6	36	36	24	The level 20 dark sorceress leads a cult hidden in the mists of a nebula. She hopes to convert this edgeof the rim to her sacrosanct beleifs. Unbeknown to most of the sector, she also has affluent supporters in the Core who would like to use her as a proxy to dominate this edge of the rim and leverage her against the powerful church in the Core. Lady Tai's devout followers have access to a "soul searching" ability - basically a mix of reading microexpressions amplified with nanite-enhanced senses - to make them very hard for anyone other than the lady to bluff. All of Lady Tai's high level servants must attend a confession periodically with the Lady herself and her other followers to check how well they are reading minds and if they are truly searching one another's heart so that no seed of corruption takes hold.\r\nLady Tai looks like Maisie Richardson Sellers, who is 5'6" African Caribbean and Caucasian.  Her hair is just longer than her shoulders, black and tightly curly. She had cosmetic surgery  on her eyes. Her right eye is naturally deep brown, but with a tattooed gold ring around the  Iris. Her left eye is tatooed grey ad white. It's said that she can see the world of the living with her right eye and the world of the dead with her left. Her ears have 7 piercings with tiny gold rings in each one. Her arms, hands, legs, feet, neck, back and face are subtely  tattooed with a thin line just a shade lighter than her skintone that outlines her skeleton. There is a flourescent pigment in the tatoo that lights up under a blacklight. Her left hand  and arm is painted with neon green and purple tribal designs. She wears a white robe of  draped hand-woven local Kalimba plant fiber. She walks barefoot in "blessed" (cult-owned) land, but wears simple sandals elsewhere.\r\n//dev note, played by Kari Hedges in first playthrough.	Leader	20	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
35	High Priest of Lady Tia	120	160	3	12	7	10	11	6	5	24	22	24	Lady Tia's High Priest has seen the light of Lady Tia's power, and has tasted of it himself. He is often called upon to be the public face of Lady Tia's church and to spread the word and work miracles where Lady Tia cannot go. He is fierily loyal and craves the attention of the crowd and Lady Tia herself. He is patient, cunning, gregarious and not easily shaken. What are the mere problems of adventurers wielding guns or magic when one has witnessed Lady Tia's power over life and death? The high priest also has a dualistic attitude. He preaches Lady Tia's mercy and peace for all, whilst having no problem sending followers to painful deaths or ordering operations with high civilian collateral damage. 	Leader	15	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
37	Machine Empire Squire	110	120	4	12	6	4	7	12	5	14	8	36	Designed and constructed by the legendary Imperial engineer 0x3dd1e, the Squire is built from the ground-up to serve alongside his assigned Knight.  His keen sensors and general attitude of awareness pairs well with his teammates. 0x3dd1e also programmed all squires with a set of pathfinding skills such as survival, tracking, and some minor engineering talent. They can construct small camps or even given enough time a small redoubt. 	Scout	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
38	Machine Empire Master-At-Arms	130	120	8	6	8	3	7	8	7	18	10	16	The Master-At-Arms was also created by legendary Machine Empire engineer 0xe3dd1e specifically for the Knight of the Empire team. The Master-At-Arms functions as the super-ego of the squad. He is fiercely loyal to the Emperor, His Rootness, and views all machine life as unworthy to serve him. The Master-At-Arms functions as the moral and disciplinary center of the group. As such, he disagrees frequently with Minstrel, keeping him in line. In combat, the Master-At-Arms functions as the auxilary fire support, using the knight as the anchor of the formation and flanking as required. The Master-At-Arms also has a number of duties regarding maintaining and restocking the limited ammo that the knight can carry into combat. As such, the Master-At-Arms carries a number of satchels, 3D printers and extra weapons on him at all times, as is his solemn duty. He will not abandon the munitions in his charge, even if doing so would lead to his fiery, explosive death. 	Support	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
39	Machine Empire Minstrel	110	140	4	6	6	9	9	9	6	18	18	18	The Minstrel was designed and built by 0x3dd1e to serve as a part of the Imperial Knight detachment. In terms of personality, each member of the team is a part of a whole person, a whole unit. The Minstrel serves as the Id of the group. He loves explosions, fast-paced action, a quick retort and seeing his teammates kick butt. He tends to argue with the Master-At-Arms to try to keep the old stickler from being too rigid to be adaptable. In terms of function, the Minstrel records, catalogs and reports on operations back to the Empire. He also is the diplomatic face of the detachment in the rare case that they need to talk their way into or out of a jam. In combat, the Minstrel is charged with repairing his damaged or fallen teammates on-the-fly. 	Healer	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
36	Admiral Koga	260	150	12	8	16	8	10	8	5	40	36	20	The small-time pirate lord Koga was tasked by the Sakai corporation to patrol the rim of the sector.\r\nAfter a falling out with the Sakai royal family, the then captain mutinied and stole his current flagship\r\nfrom the corp and began a series of very successful raids on both merchant ships and even full space stations.\r\nHis notoriety has gathered to him a small armada of other pirates, who serve him with uncommon loyalty.\r\nIn the rare event that Koga is cornered and death seems certain, Koga cleverly has the tendency to crash\r\nships and generally fake his own death.  \r\n//dev note: name comes from the Japanese admiral who replaced Yamomoto in WWII. \r\nDeath-faking is a bit of a conspiracy nod. In real life, Koga died in flight in a typhoon.	Leader	20	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
40	Machine Empire Vagabond	130	90	8	8	8	4	4	9	2	12	12	22	The Machine Empire consists mostly of refugees and vagabonds. Droids and machines that have been liberated from their cruel enslavement at the hands of the Terran Empire and her Organic-dominant society. The vagabonds typically have thrown off the yoke of indentured servitude only to have to scrap out a living in the mostly impoverished Empire to survive. Most vagabonds are bipedal, two-armed droids about 2 meters tall give or take. Like most of the denizens of the Machine empire, they require periodic access to energy to stay alive. The personalities of vagabonds vary greatly. Some are cold and calculating, some are fairly empathetic. But desperation changes behavior and even the most noble vagabond can be driven to drastic action to preserve themselves or their batch. Vagabonds are not trained specifically for combat, but rather are generalists under the authority of His Rootness (May he Compute Forever) the Emperor 0x000000. As such, they often have a variety of skills ranging from dish cleaning, to construction. 	Infantry	5	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218
41	Machine Empire Refugee	90	80	7	8	4	4	3	8	3	2	4	20	The rank-and-file of the Machine Empire are the refugee droids that it frees from the various factions around it. Most of these droids are not trained for combat. Most of these droids have their freedom and not much else. And so must fight to survive. Most Refugee bots are bipedal and have two arms. They typically stand around 2 meters tall, give or take. Like most droids in the Machine Empire, Refugees need to consume energy periodically to continue to survive. Each Refugee droid doesn't have built-in infra-red vision, as these are standard for security droids, but not all droids. They don't have to breathe however and can move through water, poisonous gas or a vacuum without ill effect. 	Minion	1	ADMIN Bleehu	2017-11-01 15:28:56.480218

7	Snow Bullymong Fur	100	This tangled and ropey matted white fur isn't too great at stopping blades or bullets, but it excells at keeping things warm. If hit with a cold-type weapon, it negates 80 damage from the attack. It also protects from damage and status effects from penalties from environmental cold.	ADMIN Bleehu	Full	0	0	0	0	\N	0
9	Refugee Rags	10	Unadorned cheap textiles draped cleverly around this unit's body. Cleverly tied to allow for free movement, but maintaining decency. While not much to look at, the rags are decently comfortable, surprisingly warm yet breathable. They have pockets for 3 primary mags, 4 secondary mags and 2 grenades. The unit wearing this armor gets a 15% penalty to persuasion and bartering skill checks. 	ADMIN Bleehu	Recon	0	0	0	0	\N	0
10	Machine Empire Knight's Armor	80	The thick interlocking alloy plates make a satisfying clicking-clang noise as they articulate around the wearer. It features pronounced shoulder pauldrons, heavy greaves and a geometric ornate chest piece. The helmet has a fold-down grille with slits for eye holes. The wearer of this armor has a move penalty of 2m/action and a 100 point shield.

5	Pirate Firesuit	100	This full suit of flame retardant gear was probably originally intended for use fighting fires on cargo cruisers. Since then it has had crude pockets for grenades and some extra bulletproofing added. The wearer of this suit has a -1m/action movement penalty, but is immune to fire damage.	ADMIN Bleehu	Heavy	2	60	4	400	None	1

8	Kletturkett Hide	80	The thick hide of the so called "Rock Cat" is where the beast gets it's name from. Its interlocking keratin scales cover it's back, but not some softer patches on its neck and belly. The armor gives a +15 to stealth checks in desert or sandy environments. Live Kletturkett hide reduces incoming laser fire by 20 points. A skilled survivalist can harvest the hide from a dead Kletturkett with a survivor check of 80. It makes a set of heavy armor which carries 3 primary and 5 secondary mags. 	ADMIN Bleehu	Full	6	260	2	1200	None	2
1	Pirate plate	80	Steel plates attached haphazardly to ragged work harnesses and tool belts. It's not pretty to look at, but it'll get the job done.	ADMIN Bleehu	Heavy	3	120	6	340	None	1

15	Admiral Koga's Armor	75	The long, regal robes of a Sakai Admiral are adorned with battle damage and pirate patches. They drape over expensive, customized heavy armor with thick alloy trauma plates and many pockets holding magazines at ergonomic angles. Long loose sleeves obscure a bulge in the armor attached to the left arm, and the tell-tale shimmer of a shield crackles around the deserter as he moves.

Grapples to any hard surface within 10m, 2 ropes (reloadable), can scale the rope at 3 meters per action as a free action, but uses an arm if mounted on an arm hardpoint.

4	Relic Rifle	55	30	This is a really old assault rifle mostly held together with duct tape, but some of the old wood buttstock still gleams.

5	Pirate Blunderbuss	50	4	A crude weapon little more than a tube with pin that ignites shotgun shells. Devastating at close range, its effectiveness falls off quickly at a distance. It deals 80 damage up to 3m, 50 damage out to 10m and 30 damage out to 30m.	ADMIN Bleehu	Shotgun	20	1	2	3	0	0	0	0	15	0	0	0	0	None	2017-11-01 15:32:07.237009

7	Pirate Antimaterial Rifle	54	1	Jams on a 1 or 2. Comes with a crude scope mounted. Ignores the first 30 DR from armor. Half Action to fire. Full action to reload. Requires a strength 7 to use, comes with a 2 point sling attached.  (stats included above. ) Unit cannot be silenced. Fires custom crude charges. A target hit with this weapon that doesn't take full damage from it must make a Shock Save of DC 60 or get knocked over.

13	Makeshift Mounted Gun	60	80	Clearly cobbled together by some cantankerous corsair. The Makeshift Mounted gun has a massive single magazine mounted to it and is held together with spot welds and duct tape. It jams on rolls of 1 or 2 and must be cleared by a sentient operator. It fires in bursts of three rounds per action. It is usually deployed by Pirate Tinkerers as part of their Tinker Turrets, though it has other uses. One could carry it around, but it is quite unwieldy and one using it suffers a 2m per action movement penalty if they have the 7 strength to carry it at all. It cannot be silenced nor can it be equipped with optics. 	ADMIN Bleehu	Automatic Rifle	40	1	2	3	0	0	0	0	15	0	0	0	0	None	2017-11-01 15:32:07.237009

18	ME-11c Tazer Carbine	45	20	The standard-issue weapon of choice for the Machine Empire. It is manufactured domestically. The bullpup design facilitates handling the larger and more expensive electric discharge round. While the typically bare rails and lack of an ergonomic foregrip reflect its common use among machines. On hit, the target must make a DC 40 shock check, or lose an action next turn due to tazing. Please note that many cybernetic species have a weakness to shock damage, such as Security Drone and Cyborg. It makes a distinctive electric crackling sound when fired.

25	Imperial Knight's Plasma Claymore	60	1	This massive plasma sword glows with a neon green. It leaves 2 tokens of plasma burn on hit. 	ADMIN Bleehu	Melee	0	1	1	2	0	0	3	10	0	1	10	0	800	None	2017-11-01 15:32:07.237009

30	MSE-8a Taser Shotgun	70	6	The MSE-8a is produced in the Machine Empire mostly for use in close-quarters combat against other rogue cybernetics. Once a target is hit with this weapon, they must roll three DC 40 Shock checks and lose an action next turn due to tazing for each roll failed. On success, no tazing effect occurs. The MSE-8a is a pump action, so the unit using it must spend an action operating the rack between shots.  The gun itself has a dull chrome sheen to it, a hollow metal plate buttstock and a large round recoil-compensating barrel grip. When loaded, the gun glows with an electric blue light. This light dies when the gun is empty.	ADMIN Bleehu	Shotgun	22	5	15	25	1	3	4	1	35	0	6	0	0	None	2017-11-01 15:32:07.237009
