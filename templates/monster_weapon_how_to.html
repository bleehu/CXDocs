                    <h2 id="power_curve"> Power Curve </h2>
                    <p> The statistics of weapons as plotted against their level requirement defines a curve which is concave-up. Mathematically, a level 10 weapon does more than 2 x the damage of a level 5 weapon of the same type, given similar range, accuracy and capacity. This is because there are many factors that make up both enemies and allies. As the game progresses and players level up, each of these factors increase quasi-linearly. Thus to maintain balance, the aggregate performance of a level-appropriate weapon must increase geometrically. </p>
                    <p> So when giving other developers feedback on their enemies or weapons, we say that a weapon which underperforms all others is <strong class="text-info">Below the Power Curve</strong>. We can balance that back out by either increasing the weapon's stats, or by lowering the level of the weapon so that players encounter the weak weapon earlier. This adjustment, one which increases a weapon or enemy's power is called <strong class="text-info">Buffing</strong> that weapon or enemy.</p>
                    <p>By the same measure, a weapon that is better than all other weapons at its same level is said to be <strong class="text-info">Above the Power Curve</strong>. This is a big problem. If there is one weapon at any level that is better than all the rest, then all of the players will want to/need to use that one, even if they have to kill an enemy to acquire it. Which means that all of the other weapons at that level are wasted. To fix a weapon which is above the Power Curve, we have two choices. On the one hand, we can bump the power of every other weapon at that level up. This is very bad, because that leads to a design problem known as <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxszx60ZwGw&t=22s">Power Creep</a></strong>. Power Creep makes it very hard to balance the rest of the game and invalidates rewards given to players before the power bump. On the other hand, the better solution is to <strong class="text-info">Nerf</strong> the weapon which is Above the Power Curve. Nerfing is an adjustment which lowers the power of the weapon.</p>

                    <h2 id="diff_kind"> Differences in Kind </h2>
                    <p> Extra Credits has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBR1z-ue-I">fantastic 7 minute youtube video</a> about differences in scale and differences in kind. They do a better job of explaining it than I could do. </p>

                    <h2 id="Telegraphing"> Telegraphing </h2>
                    <p> Having a frail-looking little girl kick the player's asses with her 800 health and sick ninja moves may feel great to you, but it's terrible design. To avoid play that isn't fun for the players, we use a design technique called <strong class="text-info">Telegraphing</strong>. </p>
                    <p>Your best tool for helping the GM running your enemies out is to put good wording into your descriptions. In the ideal case, a GM could simply read from your description (perhaps only a part of the description, if you'd like the GM to know something about the weapon that the players might not). That description should have good telegraphing to pass on to the players so that smart players who are paying attention can intuit what's coming their way. </p>
                    <p> Extra Credits has a great video on <a href="https://youtu.be/ea6UuRTjkKs?t=1m59s"> Difficulty and Telegraphing</a> which takes only 7 and a half minutes to watch. </p>

                    <h2>Cost</h2>
                    <p>As players play against your enemies, hopefully they will win! Which means that the character guided by an enlightened sense of self-interest will collect a bunch of the weapons that you've given to the enemies that they vanquished. Maybe you can see where this is going. In general, you will want enemy weapons to have a cheaper base price than their market-available counterparts. That way when players liquidate the loot that they've accrued, the wealth spike that they receive stays moderately under control. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, a weapon shouldn't be priced below 60% of market value for basic cost. That would be cheating the players out of value that they earned, as well as raise the question, "if these are so cheap, but so good, why doesn't everyone use 'em?". It would ruin the verisimilitude of the universe's economy. Furthermore, this stat is the base cost. Don't forget that whomever is going to buy weapons shipments from the players will likely be a businessman NPC who has quite a lot of skill in haggle to oppose the selling player. </p>

                    <h2 id="damage"> Damage </h2>
                    <p>This is the amount of damage that your weapon can do. In general, the higher the rate of fire of a given weapon, the lower the amount of damage you want that weapon to do. </p>

                <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
                    <h2 id="range"> Range </h2>
                    <p> Long range is, of course better. But there is a much bigger difference between giving a gun that has a 2m range a 5m buff, than giving a gun that has a 70m range a 2m buff. This is due to the inherent tactical risk of needing to maneuver your character (be they a player character or an enemy you are designing) into range to engage. </p>

                    <h2 id="move_penalty"> Movement Penalty </h2>
                    <p> Heavier weapons tend to have much better stats. To compensate, these weapons are given a strength requirement known as a movement penalty. Please see the Combat 2.0 rules about mitigating movement speed for more information. </p>
                    <p> Please note that by convention, a positive number 2 in our form translates to a -2 meter per action movement penalty in play. Negative movement penalties would therefore translate to wielding a weapon giving you a bonus to move. This is prevented by our system and will cause your weapon to fail our validation check. Because contrary to Counterstrike logic, wielding a knife does not make you go faster. </p>
