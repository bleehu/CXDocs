Purpose:
Reads one of our special text files and returns a list of tokens as a JSON string.

Caveats:
If a line does not translate to a token, it will be skipped (a preview for designers
would be a nice thing to implement to avoid "junk" tokens that don't show up, and
for other QA purposes, of course).

I haven't implemented the special "weapon syntax" (their data should be in a database)

Notes:
Some error checking would be great to add, but I'm a Python novice and I need to
focus on the new front end. Willing to help with that though (like a paired-
programming exercise).

Rally-ho!
